# rust-chip8

This is my first effort on trying to learn/get familiar with Rust. Code-wise it probably isn't the most elegant/clean code since I don't have a lot experience with it ðŸ™ˆ (yet)
I always wanted to learn how to develop an emulator, the chip8 turned out to be a good way to start this journey since it has relatively few opcodes and simple sound and graphics. I've used a lot of articles and to get bootstrapped I used @alexene's stream that gives a good introduction (thx!), I tried adding most of the resources I used as links you can find down below.
